# Hello-World
Introduction to the GitHub environment
My name is Duane Stephens, I live in Winter Park, Florida. I am  GIS Application Developer that specializes in asset management.
I have been married for over twenty-four years, and my wife and I have two children.
I love many outdoor activities, but Kayaking and Hiking are two of my favorite hobbies.
This Repo was created with a single, `master` branch, which is protected, meaning you can't commit changes to it. In the
software development world, maintainers typically maintain a `master` branch and create alternative branches which can
contain new features, bug fixes, etc. that need to be tested extensively before being merged back into the `master` branch.
In larger software projects there are extensive tests and tooling set up to automatically test branches to see if they
can be safely merged into master and only after passing these tests AND after review by a Maintainer of the project
can the changes be adopted into `master`.
